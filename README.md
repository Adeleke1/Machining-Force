# ANN prediction of temperature and specific cutting force of a machining process
* This is a project based on a machining experiment performed at UNC Chharlotte, where I built different neural network architecture for a [machining dataset](https://github.com/Adeleke1/Machining-Force/blob/main/mchnfrctmps.csv).
* Four different architectures were considered
  - A shallow and narrow network
   - A shallow and wide network
  - A deep and wide network
  - A deep and narrow network
* ML algorithm used: Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
* The optimal ANN architecture was identified using different metrics for performance evaluation.
* Activation functions used: Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) and hyperbolic tangent (Tanh)
